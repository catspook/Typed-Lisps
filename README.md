## Typed Lisps

This paper summarizes the historical frustrations with Lisp's dynamic typing, and how that helped lead to the creation of the Hindley-Milner typing system. It also explores how one modern Lisp, Racket, adopted the Hindley-Milner typing system, as well as my experience using it as compared to untyped Racket.  

This paper was originally written in March 2020 for PSU's CS510 Code Reading & Review course. I recently revised it to add more of my experiences using typed Racket.
